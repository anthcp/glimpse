2003-11-12 22:10  golda

	* dynfilters/htuml2txt.so: [no log message]

2003-11-12 22:10  golda

	customized configure script

2003-11-12 21:50  golda

	way...)

2003-11-02 19:40  golda

2003-02-06 05:04  golda

	Bob Proulx

2003-01-25 13:15  golda

	Kevin McGrail (KAM)

2003-01-25 13:09  golda

	* index/glimpse.h: [no log message]

2003-01-25 13:09  golda

	* agrep/compat.c: Enable use of -B option along with -n (linenum)
	as per Kevin McGrail - probably never should have been disabled in
	first place

2002-11-29 17:47  golda

	* index/glimpse.h: [no log message]

2002-11-29 17:47  golda

	* agrep/: bitap.c, compat.c, io.c: Fix typo in bitap.c,io.c and
	compat.c that prevented compiling with --enable-pointers.  Thanks
	to Clemens Fischer
	
	Correct error message about Bestmatch and Linenums, thanks to Kevin
	McGrail for pointing this out (and possible future fix to allow
	them to work together)

2002-10-10 22:28  golda

	* index/build_in.c: There was an error in build_in.c, a typo that
	prematurely terminated a for loop and resulted in missing hits for
	common search terms!  Fixed now.  This affected versions from
	4.16.2 thru 4.17.0.  If running one of those versions please
	upgrade to 4.17.1

2002-10-10 22:27  golda

	* dynfilters/htuml2txt.so: [no log message]

2002-09-27 14:41  golda

	* index/: dex.c, checksg.c, compat.c, maskgen.c, preprocess.c,
	build_in.c, glimpse.c, glimpse.h: Should compile now under CYGWIN
	(v1.3.12 or later)!  Thanks to Tom Hudson for the tip, with the
	latest cygwin it seems that all that is needed is to add some
	include <errno.h> lines.  Please report problems or other changes
	needed!

2002-09-06 01:11  golda

	* glimpse.1, glimpseindex.1, glimpseserver.1: Updated man pages to
	reflect new URL's, thanks to Kang-Jin Lee for reporting this and
	providing the new Harvest doc locations.

2002-06-17 23:45  golda

	* index/: filetype.c, glimpse.h: Finaly fixed segfault bug with
	large indexes, by increasing size of guilty buffer.  Actually this
	is better than checking for buffer overrun because if we just stop
	at overrun we miss hits.  With new size no overruns should be able
	to occur, that is the correct solution.  Has been tested on two
	sites that were experiencing the segfault and has fixed problem.

2002-06-17 23:44  golda

	* dynfilters/htuml2txt.so: [no log message]

2002-05-02 21:43  golda

	better on some linux systems

2002-02-14 17:38  golda

	* index/glimpse.h: Corrected version number

2001-10-13 01:14  golda

	* index/build_in.c: Fix segfault on certain large indexes.  Check
	that we have enough space in merge_in before adding to it.  In
	utils.c, when counter can be incremented > once in a loop, make
	sure we stop in time.

2001-10-13 01:13  golda

	* ChangeLog: Don't need ChangeLog in CVS!

2001-08-20 22:06  golda

	variable to include only  -ldl	if needed in index/Makefile

2001-08-20 20:59  golda

2001-07-05 10:30  golda

	* configure: Corrected help text

2001-07-05 03:32  golda

	* index/: ure, glimpse.h: Moved FILE_END_MARK option into configure
	script (--file-end-mark=) instead of glimpse.h

2001-07-04 13:22  golda

	* agrep/Makefile, compress/Makefile, dynfilters/Makefile.in,
	index/Makefile: [no log message]

2001-07-04 13:22  golda

	* Makefile: Providing Makefile.in for configure script, for
	dynfilters may or may not work on all systems; we need to add a
	configure switch to turn them off if necessary.

2001-07-02 21:58  golda

	problem with agrep.

	bitap.c, ss/Makefile.in, ss/test.c, Makefile.in, convert.c,
	glimpse.h: Major fixes to configure script from Sang-yong Suh.	Now
	it works!

2001-03-05 21:14  golda

	* README: Testing cvs problem

2000-12-06 16:11  golda

	* index/: recursive.c, ss/cast.c, ss/trecursive.c, ss/uncast.c,
	build_in.c, dir.c, filetype.c, glimpse.h: Use strerror(errno)
	instead of arbitrary "permission denied or nonexistent" error
	message, as suggested by ariel.  Fixes bug #45.

2000-11-16 22:47  golda

	* split.c: Added dirs "lib" and "bin" to repository, also for some
	reason split.c had never been checked in.

2000-08-15 21:23  golda

	* CHANGES, ChangeLog: Used cvs2cl.pl to generate up-to-date
	ChangeLog from CVS.  All old manually entered change information is
	in CHANGES file.

2000-08-15 15:07  golda

	* main.c: tiny formatting change

2000-08-15 15:04  golda

	* main.c: Corrected help output for -t switch

2000-08-14 17:06  golda

	* index/glimpse.h: Re-set name of filter file to .glimpse_filters,
	instead of the temporary name .glimpse_experimental_filters.  This
	would have caused HTML tags in the output of glimpse 4.13.0a and
	4.13.0, unless .glimpse_experimental_filters existed.  Also
	corrected minor bug introduced in 4.12.6, in reading temp_rdelim
	(two lines were transposed). Probably didn't affect anything
	because the default delimiter is normally correct.

2000-07-16 22:34  golda

	* agrep/agrep.h: Changed leaf.attribute to type int to fix pointer
	to integer compiler warnings.  Was used as int anyway, should not
	hurt anything.

2000-06-21 13:13  golda

	* COPYRIGHT: [no log message]

2000-05-30 13:01  golda

	Christian's changes to allow dynamic filters.  I believe this has
	only been tested on Linux systems.  --GV

2000-05-25 11:06  golda

	* Makefile, Makefile.linux: Added Christian's changes to allow
	dynamic filters

2000-04-20 13:27  golda

2000-03-08 11:51  golda

	* agrep/agrep.c: Patch from Dan Riley to fix glimpseserver crashing
	problems.  Basically make sure multibuf is always set to NULL after
	it is freed, and freed before it is et to NULL.  --GV

2000-01-20 06:04  golda

	* index/filetype.c: Added separator char before "xinfo" variable. 
	This is needed to parse the URL out of the results and correctly
	make links in webglimpse's output.  Fix as per Victor Gonzales T. 
	--GV

2000-01-15 23:52  golda

	* index/filetype.c: Corrected problem with multiple-line titles and
	files with spaces in the names.  FILE_END_MARK was being used in
	the wrong place, where multiple-line titles were being stuck
	together.  --GV

2000-01-15 22:47  golda

	* agrep/checksg.c: Don't use mgrep() with delimiters - fix by Morey
	as per report by Michael O. --GV

2000-01-11 11:34  cpv298

	* index/filetype.c: Fixed a nasty off-by-one error in
	extract_info() that clobbered memory past the end of arrays.
	glimpseindex -X should now stop segfaulting.
