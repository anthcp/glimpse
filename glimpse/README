GLIMPSE 4.18: searching entire file systems

For installation instructions, see README.install

Glimpse is a very powerful indexing and query system that allows you to
search through all your files very quickly.  It can be used by
individuals for their personal file systems as well as by organizations
for large data collections.  Glimpse is also the basis of WebGlimpse,
which provides search for web sites, and it is the default search engine 
in Harvest (see below).

Glimpseindex, which you run by saying "glimpseindex DIR" builds an
index of all text files in the tree rooted at DIR.  
(e.g., glimpseindex ~ indexes all your files.) With it, glimpse can
search through all files much the same way as agrep (or any other
grep), except that you don't have to specify file names and the search
is fast.  For example,

	glimpse -1 unbelievable

will find all occurrences (in all your files!) of "unbelievable" 
allowing one spelling error;

	glimpse -F mail arizona 

will find all occurrences of "arizona" in all files with "mail" somewhere
in their name;

	glimpse  'Arizona desert;windsurfing' 

will find all lines that contain both "Arizona desert" and "windsurfing".

Glimpse supports three types of indexes: a tiny one (2-3% of the
size of all files), a small one (7-9%), and a medium one (20-30%).
The larger the index the faster the search.
Glimpse supports most of agrep's options (agrep is our powerful version
of grep, and it is part of glimpse) including approximate matching
(e.g., finding misspelled words), Boolean queries, and even some
limited forms of regular expressions.
